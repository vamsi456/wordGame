 * <p/>
 * A service interface to support a word game.
 * <p/>
 * The objective of the game is to make words using only the letters contained in a supplied starting set e.g. the
 * letters in the string "areallylongword". You can assume that the starting set of letters is all lowercase and there
 * are no whitespace or special characters.
 * <p/>
 * Implementations of this interface are intended to support multiple players playing the game for example through a
 * web or desktop application user interface. Multiple players will see the same set of starting letters and will
 * compete against each other to produce the longest valid word from those starting letters. Submitted words are validated against
 * a collection of valid words supplied in the resources/wordlist.txt file (this text file is loaded in the ValidWordsImpl class).
 * Players score one point for each letter in a valid submitted word.
 * <p/>
 * A leaderboard is built showing the highest scoring words. The maximum number of word submissions in the leaderboard
 * is 10. The leaderboard should contain the player name, the word and score, with the highest scoring word first and
 * the lowest scoring word last.
 * <p/>
 * If two submitted words have the same score, the one submitted first should have a higher position in the
 * leaderboard.
 * <p/>
 * A specific word can only appear once in the leaderboard. If a player submits a word that is already in the
 * leaderboard it should not be added to the leaderboard again (i.e. the words in the leaderboard should be unique).
 * <p/>
 * A single player can submit multiple different words. Each submission should be treated independently and be added to
 * the leaderboard if appropriate.
 * <p/>
 * Given the starting string "areallylongword", the following submissions are scored as detailed below (these are
 * included in the outline test class SubmissionTest).
 * <ul>
 * <li>"all" is an acceptable submission, with score 3. It is a valid word of length 3</li>
 * <li>"word" is an acceptable submission, with score 4. It is a valid word of length 4</li>
 * <li>"tale" is NOT an acceptable, submission. There is no "t" in the starting string</li>
 * <li>"glly" is NOT an acceptable submission. The letters are in the starting string but the word is not present
 * in the ValidWords collection</li>
 * <li>"woolly" is an acceptable submission with score 6</li>
 * <li>"adder" is NOT an acceptable submission, since there is only one "d" in the starting string</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * Throughout this test, you need not worry about whitespace, special characters, or uppercase. You may assume that both
 * the original starting string of letters and all submissions contain none of these.
